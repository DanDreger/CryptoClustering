# CryptoClustering

A project using unsupervised learning and python to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

## Dependencies

* Pandas
* hvplot
* matplotlib
* pyplot
* sklearn
* jupyter notebook
* Python

## Process

* Prepare csv data using StandardScaler()
* Find the Best Value for k
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means
* Perform a Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Evaluate the differences between clusters with and without doing PCA first
